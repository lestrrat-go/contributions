# CONTRIBUTING

# Please be nice

Please be nice when you contact us.

We are very glad that you find this project useful, and we intend to provide software that help you.

You do not have to thank us, but please bare in mind that this is an opensource project that is provided **as-is**.
This means that we are **NOT** obligated to support you, work for you, do your homework/research for you,
or otherwise heed to you needs.

We do not owe you one bit of code, or a fix, even if it's a critical one.

We write software because we're curious, we fix bugs because we have integrity.

But we do not owe you anything. Please do not order us to work for you.
We are not your support staff, and we are not here to do your research.
We are willing to help, but only as long as you are being nice to us.

# Please Use Correct Medium (GitHub Issues / Discussions)

We use GitHub Issues to deal with technical issues including bug reports,
proposing new API, and otherwise issues that are directly actionable.

Inquiries, questions about the usage, maintenance policies, and other open-ended
questions/discussions should be posted to GitHub Discussions.

# Please Include (Pseudo)code for Any Technical Issues

Your report should contain clear, concise description of the issue that you are facing.
However, at the same time please always include (pseudo)code in report.

English may not be your forte, but we all should speak the common language of code.
Rather than trying to write an entire essay or beat around the bush, which will
more than likely cost both you and the maintainers extra roundtrips to communicate,
please use code to describe _exactly_ what you are trying to achieve.

Good reports should contain (in order of preference):

1. Complete Go-style test code.
1. Code snippet that clearly shows the intent of your code.
1. Pseudocode that shows how you would want the API to work.

As we are dealing with code, ultimately there is
no better way to convey what you are trying to do than to provide
your code.

Please help us help you by providing us with a reproducible code.
